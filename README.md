The provided Weather Forecasting System code is a Java-based graphical user interface (GUI) application built using the Abstract Window Toolkit (AWT). It allows users to input a city name and generates simulated weather data, such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, and precipitation, displayed dynamically on the interface. The main frame includes labeled sections for displaying weather parameters and alerts, such as "Heat Alert" or "Rain Alert," based on randomly generated thresholds. AWT components like Frame, Label, TextField, Button, and Dialog are used for creating an intuitive GUI, while event handling with ActionListener enables functionality for retrieving and updating data upon button clicks. The application demonstrates core Java concepts such as GUI design, event-driven programming, and color-coded feedback, making it a practical example of real-time data simulation with a user-friendly interface.
